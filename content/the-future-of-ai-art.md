## Art as a Casino
It is tempting to treat artists as R&D researchers. Most artists aren’t making products; they’re doing R&D. That’s why they make no money. Very few artists like Taylor Swift are even interested in the product side of things. By this view, Disney’s best bet is hiring hundreds of artists to just do whatever and greenlight the most commercially compelling work.

Nobody does this. Not because they're stupid, but because this strategy doesn't work for art. The closest equivalent is A24. TODO: introduce A24
But they aren't like YC in the sense that they don't build from scratch. They go to film festivals and acquire finished R&D projects. In this sense, they're less of an incubator and more like a private equity firm. Moreover it doesn't scale. TODO: explain why this can't scale to a studio like Disney

You can't treat the art industry like tech because unlike tech, the art industry is fundamentally broken. it relies on irrational actors and extreme outliers. The math is terrible no matter how you cut it. TODO: explain how the cost of R&D is high due to the time investment and how the vast majority of artists go broke, but the payoff of becoming Lady Gaga is huge. This asymmetric upside keeps the engine running.

And who is paying this cost? If it was a rational market, you'd expect the VCs and companies to come in here. But in art, the Disneys of the world sleep. They let the _artists_ subsidize their own R&D. TODO: elaborate on how artists are expected to continue their day job and whatnot whilst working on the R&D. As a result, corporations get a massive pool of "pre-vetted" talent and ideas for free.

But why would artists do this to themselves? it is brutally inefficient and even cruel for an individual artist to work for years on a project that might never pay off. TODO: introduce the "passion tax"

The only reason this isn't considered _pure exploitation_ is Psychic Income. Artists receive a "wage" in the form of identity, status, and emotional fulfillment. To the artist, the work is the reward; the money is just a bonus. To the corporation, the artist's fulfillment is a subsidy that lowers their production costs.

This phenomenon creates a "Barbell Economy" where art becomes both cheaper and more expensive simultaneously, while the quality splits into two extremes. TODO: introduce the consequences of the Barbell economy

The system is highly efficient for consumers (who get infinite art for cheap) but brutal for artists (who carry 100% of the risk). Art is "better" if you like variety, but "worse" if you want bold, high-budget risks from major studios.

## Enter AI

So how does AI art fit into this "business model"? One might assume this shifts things by making the R&D free. I suspect a lot of people in Silicon Valley have this sentiment. But what they miss is that the R&D was _already_ free. As in, the artists were already eating the costs themselves. The problem for Disney, HBO and Apple TV+ is not creating R&D but rather filtering out the garbage.

The vast majority of new art is terrible. This is not a fault - R&D is allowed to be terrible, that's the whole point. But it creates a problem when trying to commercialize. Because there is no objective metric for what makes art "good", we have to wait for the market to decide what sticks.

This isn't my fringe out-of-touch high-tech take. TODO: introduce Anthony Fantano Just listen to what Anthony Fantano has to say about 80s music being "better" than the music today:
> TODO: quote Anthony Fantano

An AI model which can predict what art will be good ahead of time will make billions. The only problem is that this task is impossible. TODO: explain how studios are already doing this, the safe-hot trap, how this has lead to nothing but sequels. Conclude that finding outliers is just random noise and the market is the best engine for doing it reliably

The moment we have a model
