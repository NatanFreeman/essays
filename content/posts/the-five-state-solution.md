## Thesis

The current political crisis in Israel is not merely a struggle over one leader
(Bibi) or specific policies; it is a fundamental rejection of the "Normal
Nation" model (centralized, authoritative, and monolithic) in favor of the
original Jewish blueprint: a decentralized, tribal, and anti-authoritarian
federation. To save the Jewish state, Israel must "kill" the 19th-century
concept of a monolithic state and return to the "Tabernacle" model of communal
coexistence.

## The Two "Kings" of Israel

Bibi has been criticized for being too authoritarian. Critics point to his
judicial overhaul—the attempt to weaken the Supreme Court—as the ultimate proof
of his desire to become a dictator. They look at his grip on the Likud party,
where he has systematically purged any potential successor, and see a man who
thinks he _is_ the state. To his detractors, every move he makes is calculated
to dismantle the gatekeepers and consolidate control in the Prime Minister's
office.

There's something surprising about this modern anti-Bibi view. After all, Bibi
is far from the most authoritarian figure Israel has had. Not by a long shot.
That honor would go to David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister. He makes
Bibi look like a libertarian hippie by comparison. So why are people criticizing
Bibi? It seems like Ben-Gurion established a far stricter precedent.

Critics try to explain this away by blaming "populism." They argue that
Netanyahu incites the mob against the elites, destroying institutions from the
outside, whereas Ben-Gurion _was_ the elite building them from the inside. They
claim the difference is one of style: Ben-Gurion was a statesman who centralized
power to build a nation, while Bibi is a demagogue centralizing power to save
his own skin. But this distinction is lazy. It ignores the fact that Ben-Gurion
hunted political rivals, fired on Jewish ships, and controlled the press with an
iron fist that Bibi could only dream of.

To truly understand why Ben-Gurion "got away with it" while Bibi didn't, we need
to understand Ben-Gurion's historical context. He wasn't just building a state;
he was trying to overwrite the Jewish identity. Ben-Gurion was obsessed with
_Mishma'at_ (Discipline). He looked at the "Old Jew" of the
Diaspora—argumentative, tribal, stateless—and saw weakness. He wanted to create
a "New Jew" who was a soldier-farmer, a cog in the great machine of the State.
And because the Jews of 1948 were facing a literal war of annihilation, they
accepted the bargain. The trauma of the Holocaust and the fragility of the
newborn state meant that people were willing to suppress their nature. They
traded their _Chutzpah_ for survival. They let "The Old Man" (_HaZaken_) drive
the bus without question because they were terrified the bus was about to drive
off a cliff.

But then came 1967. We won the Six-Day War, the existential panic subsided, and
the "Jewish DNA" woke up. The moment the people stopped feeling like refugees,
they remembered they were Jews—the descendants of prophets who argued with
Kings. They didn't want to listen to _HaZaken_ anymore. Ben-Gurion couldn't
handle this shift. He became isolated, bitter, and eventually, his own party
chewed him up and spit him out. He left behind no system, no successor, only a
void. This is exactly the tragedy Bibi is repeating. Like Ben-Gurion, he has
identified the State with himself to such a degree that he has ensured there is
no one "authorized" to take the wheel when he's gone.

Really, it's a historical coincidence that Ben-Gurion's gambit worked for as
long as it did. But it was never going to last. Israel cannot have a strong
state like Singapore for instance. Such a model relies on a populace willing to
trade liberty and expression for efficiency and air-conditioning. But it is not
in the blood of the Jewish people to be subservient. We are the stiff-necked
people. We would rather bicker and fight in tents than be submissive in a
10-story duplex.

If Ben-Gurion were to stand on a balcony overlooking the modern protests in Tel
Aviv, he wouldn't just be angry; he would suffer a total existential crisis. He
spent his life trying to engineer the "New Jew," a disciplined Spartan who would
subordinate his ego to the Mamlachtiyut (Statism). He wanted a monolithic block
of granite; instead, he got a chaotic mosaic of a million jagged pieces.

By Ben-Gurion’s own metrics, he failed. He didn't kill the "Old Jew" of the
Diaspora; he just gave him a Hebrew passport and F16 fighter jets. Yet, in a
twist of historical irony, this failure is our greatest asset. If we had
actually become the disciplined, obedient cogs Ben-Gurion dreamed of, we would
practically be an Eastern European country. Instead, that irrepressible
_Chutzpah_—the very refusal to accept "no" or follow a centralized command—is
what fuels the Israeli engine. You cannot build a "Startup Nation" out of
obedient drones. It is our fundamental anti-authoritarianism that allows a
twenty-year-old soldier to challenge a general, or a developer to disrupt an
entire global industry. We traded the orderly efficiency of a "Normal Nation"
for a chaotic, high-tech vitality that only a "Stiff-Necked People" could
produce.

Despite this, we still suffer from the very same issues Ben-Gurion set out to
prevent. We are more divided than ever, full of _chutzpah_ with zero unified
culture. And there is no end in sight. The "Melting Pot" has cooled into a
hardened lump of concrete, but the ingredients never actually mixed. Instead of
one "Israeli," we have four distinct tribes living in parallel universes,
sharing nothing but a power grid and a tax code. The secular resident of Tel
Aviv views the Supreme Court as the last line of defense against religious
tyranny, while the settler in Judea views it as an elitist junta suppressing the
will of the people. The Haredi in Bnei Brak views army service as a spiritual
holocaust, while the reservist views draft evasion as a moral crime. We fight
over public transportation on Shabbat, we fight over who can get married, and we
fight over what history is taught in our four completely separate school
systems. We don't just disagree on policy; we disagree on the very definition of
reality.

## Death of the State

Ben-Gurion’s "Jewish State" was based on the idea that there is one "correct"
way to be a Zionist. He believed that over time, the Haredim would disappear,
the Arabs would become quiet, and the Mizrahim would become "Europeanized"
secular laborers. The reality is that none of that happened. They all grew
stronger and more self-assured.

This creates direct friction with the Ben-Gurion model, in which the state is a
Zero-Sum Prize. Whoever wins the election (51%) gets to decide the "soul" of the
country for the other 49%. Everything from education curricula to laws governing
marriage and the army. Because the stakes are "The Soul of the Nation," the
"pushback" is existential. If you lose an election, you feel like your way of
life is being "killed."

The only way to save the Jewish state from its current trajectory... is to kill
the Jewish state. Israel was never _meant_ to be organized in such a centralized
architecture. We have to move from a monolithic, melting-pot entity to something
more like a Federation of Israelis. No one is going to "win." The secular
liberals won't "enlighten" the Haredim, and the Haredim won't "convert" the
secularists.

Ironically, the father of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, imagined a "Jewish State"
(_Altneuland_) that was much more like a decentralized "Company-State" or a
federation of cooperatives than Ben-Gurion’s centralized powerhouse. If you
actually look at his blueprint, Herzl didn't dream of a coercive government
enforcing a single "correct" culture. He envisioned a "New Society"—a flexible
network where communities managed their own affairs and membership was
voluntary. We revere Herzl as the prophet of the State, yet we built the one
thing he explicitly avoided: a rigid, top-down bureaucracy that tries to force
everyone into the same box.

## The Rejection of the King

Bibi and Ben-Gurion were not the first ones to propose this centralized
architecture. The first call for a centralized leader came thousands of years
ago, in the Book of Samuel. It is perhaps the most critical, yet overlooked,
moment in Jewish political history. The Elders of Israel approached the prophet
Samuel with a demand that sounds suspiciously modern: "Appoint for us a king to
judge us _like all the nations_."

The reaction from Heaven was devastating. Samuel was insulted, but God told him
to take it personally: "They have not rejected you," God says, "they have
rejected _Me_ from being king over them."

The Abarbanel highlights this. He explicitly disagrees with Maimonides, arguing
that God never commanded the Jews to have a king. To him, the monarchy was a
concession to human weakness, a departure from the ideal rather than the
fulfillment of one. He famously asked: "Why should a people need a King? A King
is only necessary for nations who have no Law. But we have the Torah!"

He is correct. After all, the divine blueprint for Israel was never a
centralized monarchy. God didn't want a "State" in the conventional sense; He
wanted a Federation. He designed a system of twelve distinct tribes, each with
its own territory, culture, and economy, bound together not by a strongman
executive, but by a shared spiritual covenant. In God's vision, there was no
seat for a human King because that seat was already taken.

But the people insisted. They didn't want to be special; they wanted to be
"normal." They wanted the security and efficiency of a monarch. This ancient
demand to be like all the other nations"—is the exact same impulse driving
modern Zionism. Ben-Gurion wanted Israel to be a "normal" socialist state with
its own criminals and policemen. Bibi wants Israel to be a "normal" economic
superpower like Singapore. Both men fell into the trap of believing that the
only way to survive is to copy the political architecture of the Gentiles. They
viewed the decentralized, tribal chaos of Jewish life as a bug to be patched,
rather than a feature designed by God Himself.

History shows us exactly where this desire leads. The "United Monarchy"—ancient
Israel’s brief attempt at being a regional superpower under Solomon—ultimately
backfired in the days of his son, Rehoboam. When Solomon died, the tribes came
to the new King with a simple request: the central government had become too
heavy, the taxes too high, the demands too great. They asked for the "yoke" to
be lightened.

Rehoboam faced the classic dictator’s dilemma. His older, wiser advisors told
him to serve the people and compromise. But his young, arrogant advisors told
him to project strength. They told him that he "must have that iron in him".
Rehoboam listened and delivered the most disastrous speech in Jewish history:
"My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."

The result was immediate and catastrophic. The people didn't bow down; they
walked away. The cry went up: _"To your tents, O Israel!"_

This is the ancient version of the modern protest. When a leader tries to
tighten the screws of the central authority—whether it’s Rehoboam with his taxes
or Bibi with his judicial reforms—the "Jewish DNA" rejects the transplant. The
tribes retreat to their tents. The Kingdom splits.

The tragedy is that we usually read "To your tents, O Israel!" as a cry of
rebellion, a sign of failure. But perhaps it was actually a moment of clarity.
Perhaps the people were instinctively running away from a foreign political
model that was suffocating them and running back to the only structure that ever
actually worked for the Jews.

They were running away from the Stone House and back to the Tent.

We must understand that the "House of David"—that brief, glorious century of
centralized rule—was a historical anomaly, not the default setting of our
people. It was a desperate reaction to a specific geopolitical nightmare: the
rise of iron-wielding superpowers like the Philistines and the looming threats
of Egypt and Aram. The people demanded a King because they needed a
Commander-in-Chief to stop them from being slaughtered. They were willing to pay
the price of "being like the nations"—the taxes, the bureaucracy, the loss of
tribal autonomy—in exchange for physical survival.

This is the exact same bargain we made with Ben-Gurion. We accepted the
"straitjacket" of Statism because the alternative was being pushed into the sea.
But straitjackets are for emergencies, not for daily life. The cost of
maintaining this artificial unity is the "Scorpions" we see today: a political
system where every sector tries to conquer the center to force its will on the
others. A Five State Solution breaks this cycle. It acknowledges that the
centralized "United Monarchy" was a temporary wartime necessity, and allows us
to return to the only structure that can hold our diversity without crushing it:
a loose federation where the tribes handle their own culture, and the "King" is
reduced to nothing more than a Minister of Defense.

## From Temple to Tabernacle

Some of you might reject this idea of a decentralized federation, arguing that
"division is what destroyed the Second Temple." We are taught that _Sinat
Chinam_ (baseless hatred) shattered the Jewish people, and therefore, we need
strong, centralized unity to prevent it from happening again. But this
completely misses the point. The uncomfortable theological truth is that God
never _wanted_ a Temple. When David offered to build a permanent house, God
reminded him that He had always dwelt in a tent and a tabernacle. The _Mishkan_
(Tabernacle) was the ideal structure: it was portable, flexible, and humble. It
moved _with_ the people, visiting the tribes rather than forcing the tribes to
come to a central seat of power.

The _Sinat Chinam_ that destroyed Jerusalem didn't happen in a vacuum. It
happened precisely _because_ the Temple had become a zero-sum prize. By
centralizing all spiritual and political authority in one stone building, the
Monarchy created a situation where whoever controlled the Temple controlled the
nation. The Zealots, the Sadducees, and the Pharisees weren't just arguing over
theology; they were fighting a civil war over the "Vessel." The vessel became a
symbol of centralized authority, a weapon to be wielded against rivals. When the
stakes are total control, hatred isn't baseless—it's inevitable. The structure
itself invited the flames.

In the original divine blueprint, the Twelve Tribes were never meant to be
homogenized under a single administrative roof. They were supposed to agree on
exactly two things: Spirituality and Defense. Spirituality was represented by a
_moving_ Tabernacle that belonged to no single tribe, and Defense was handled by
temporary Judges raised up for specific threats. Everything else—culture,
economy, justice—was local.

But what about the promise of Jerusalem? Psalms 132 declares, "This is my
resting place for ever." We must distinguish between _The Place_ and _The
Building_. The tragedy of Jewish history is that we often mistake the Container
for the Presence. We fetishize the stones while ignoring the Spirit. When the
First and Second Temples were transformed from houses of prayer into tools of a
corrupt monarchy or a priestly elite, God effectively "checked out" of the
hotel. He returned to His "Tent"—dwelling among the exiled people—and left the
"Building" (the stone house) to be burned by the Babylonians and Romans. The
holiness is in the gathering of the people, not the masonry of the state.

This is why the prophet Amos, when speaking of the ultimate redemption, chooses
his words with surgical precision. He does not say that God will rebuild the
"Palace" or the "Fortress" of David. He says: "In that day I will raise up the
fallen _Sukkah_ (Tabernacle) of David." A Sukkah is a temporary, fragile hut. It
has walls that let in the wind and a roof that lets in the rain. It is the
anti-fortress. The Third Temple is not meant to be a monolithic stone tower of
Babel that dominates the skyline; it is meant to be a flexible, wandering
Tabernacle—a canopy of peace that creates unity without demanding uniformity.

## A Light to the Nations

For decades, we have interpreted the mandate to be a "Light to the Nations" as a
command to build a Middle Eastern Singapore. We measure our "light" in megawatts
of economic output, in the lethality of our missile defense systems, and in the
number of unicorns listed on the NASDAQ. But the world already has a Singapore.
It has a Japan, a Germany, and a United States. The nations of the world do not
need another lesson in how to build a high-tech economy or a powerful army.
Power is not a light; it is merely a tool, and often a dark one.

What the world actually starves for is a model of harmony. It needs a working
prototype of how radically different cultures—secular and religious, Bibi and
Bennett, left and right—can share a single geography without destroying one
another. If our only message to humanity is the "Singapore Model," then our
gospel is simply that the majority should bully the minority into assimilation.
It teaches that peace can only be achieved by crushing difference under the
heavy boot of a monolithic state.

By clinging to this version of the Zionist Dream, we are not merely applying a
skeuomorphism from 1948. Rather, we are repeating the sins of our ancestors that
date back to Biblical times. We are walking back to the prophet Samuel and
demanding a King so we can be "like all the nations." We are rejecting Yehovah
and losing the very thing that made Israel beautiful in the first place: the
holy, chaotic, decentralized freedom of a people who answer to no sovereign but
God.
