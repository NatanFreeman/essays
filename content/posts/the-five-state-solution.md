## Thesis
The current political crisis in Israel is not merely a struggle over one leader (Bibi) or specific policies; it is a fundamental rejection of the "Normal Nation" model (centralized, authoritative, and monolithic) in favor of the original Jewish blueprint: a decentralized, tribal, and anti-authoritarian federation. To save the Jewish state, Israel must "kill" the 19th-century concept of a monolithic state and return to the "Tabernacle" model of communal coexistence.

## The Two "Kings" of Israel
Bibi has been criticized for being too authoritarian. Critics point to his judicial overhaul—the attempt to weaken the Supreme Court—as the ultimate proof of his desire to become a dictator. They look at his grip on the Likud party, where he has systematically purged any potential successor, and see a man who thinks he *is* the state. To his detractors, every move he makes is calculated to dismantle the gatekeepers and consolidate control in the Prime Minister's office.

There's something surprising about this modern anti-Bibi view. After all, Bibi is far from the most authoritarian figure Israel had. Not by a long shot. That honor would go to David Ben-Gurion, Israel's first prime minister. He makes Bibi look like a libertarian hippie by comparison. So why are people criticizing Bibi? It seems like Ben-Gurion has established a far more strict precedent.

Critics try to explain this away by blaming "populism." They argue that Netanyahu incites the mob against the elites, destroying institutions from the outside, whereas Ben-Gurion *was* the elite building them from the inside. They claim the difference is one of style: Ben-Gurion was a statesman who centralized power to build a nation, while Bibi is a demagogue centralizing power to save his own skin. But this distinction is lazy. It ignores the fact that Ben-Gurion hunted political rivals, fired on Jewish ships, and controlled the press with an iron fist that Bibi could only dream of.

To truly understand why Ben-Gurion "got away with it" whilst Bibi didn't, we need to understand Ben-Gurion's historical context. He wasn't just building a state; he was trying to overwrite the Jewish identity. Ben-Gurion was obsessed with *Mishma'at* (Discipline). He looked at the "Old Jew" of the Diaspora—argumentative, tribal, stateless—and saw weakness. He wanted to create a "New Jew" who was a soldier-farmer, a cog in the great machine of the State. And because the Jews of 1948 were facing a literal war of annihilation, they accepted the bargain. The trauma of the Holocaust and the fragility of the newborn state meant that people were willing to suppress their nature. They traded their *Chutzpah* for survival. They let "The Old Man" (*HaZaken*) drive the bus without question because they were terrified the bus was about to drive off a cliff.

But then came 1967. We won the Six-Day War, the existential panic subsided, and the "Jewish DNA" woke up. The moment the people stopped feeling like refugees, they remembered they were Jews—the descendants of prophets who argued with Kings. They didn't want to listen to *HaZaken* anymore. Ben-Gurion couldn't handle this shift. He became isolated, bitter, and eventually, his own party chewed him up and spit him out. He left behind no system, no successor, only a void. This is exactly the tragedy Bibi is repeating. Like Ben-Gurion, he has identified the State with himself to such a degree that he has ensured there is no one "authorized" to take the wheel when he's gone.

Really, it's a historical coincidence that Ben-Gurion's gambit worked for as long as it did. But it was never going to last. Israel cannot have a strong state like Singapore for instance. Such a model relies on a populace willing to trade liberty and expression for efficiency and air-conditioning. But it is not in the blood of the Jewish people to be subservient. We are the stiff-necked people. We would rather bicker and fight in tents than be submissive in a 10-story duplex.

If Ben-Gurion were to stand on a balcony overlooking the modern protests in Tel Aviv, he wouldn't just be angry; he would suffer a total existential crisis. He spent his life trying to engineer the "New Jew," a disciplined Spartan who would subordinate his ego to the Mamlachtiyut (Statism). He wanted a monolithic block of granite; instead, he got a chaotic mosaic of a million jagged pieces.

By Ben-Gurion’s own metrics, he failed. He didn't kill the "Old Jew" of the Diaspora; he just gave him a Hebrew passport and F16 fighter jets.
Yet, in a twist of historical irony, this failure is our greatest asset. If we had actually become the disciplined, obedient cogs Ben-Gurion dreamed of, we would practically be an Eastern Europian country. Instead, that irrepressible *Chutzpah*—the very refusal to accept "no" or follow a centralized command—is what fuels the Israeli engine. You cannot build a "Startup Nation" out of obidient drones. It is our fundamental anti-authoritarianism that allows a twenty-year-old soldier to challenge a general, or a developer to disrupt an entire global industry. We traded the orderly efficiency of a "Normal Nation" for a chaotic, high-tech vitality that only a "Stiff-Necked People" could produce.

Despite this, we still suffer from the very same issues Ben-Gurion set out to prevent. We are more divided than ever, full of _huztpa_ with zero unified culture. And there is no end in sight. TODO: give examples showing how we are divided and can't agree on anything

## Death of the State
Ben-Gurion’s "Jewish State" was based on the idea that there is one "correct" way to be a Zionist. He believed that over time, the Haredim would disappear, the Arabs would become quiet, and the Mizrahim would become "Europeanized" secular laborers. The reality is that none of that happened. They all grew stronger and more self-assured.

This creates direct friction with the Ben-Gurion model, in which the state is a Zero-Sum Prize. Whoever wins the election (51%) gets to decide the "soul" of the country for the other 49%. Everything from the education curriculums to laws over marriage and the army. Because the stakes are "The Soul of the Nation," the "pushback" is existential. If you lose an election, you feel like your way of life is being "killed."

The only way to save the Jewish state from its current trajectory ...is to kill the Jewish state. Israel was never _meant_ to be organized in such a centralized architecture.  We have to move from monolithic, melting-pot entity to something more like a Federation of Israelis. No one is going to "win." The secular liberals won't "enlighten" the Haredim, and the Haredim won't "convert" the secularists.

TODO: The "Altneuland" Irony. Ironically, the father of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, imagined a "Jewish State" (Altneuland) that was much more like a decentralized "Company-State" or a federation of cooperatives than Ben-Gurion’s centralized powerhouse.

## The Rejection of the King
Bibi and Ben-Gurion were not the first ones to propose this centralized architecture. The first call for a centralized leader came thousands of years ago, in the Book of Samuel. It is perhaps the most critical, yet overlooked, moment in Jewish political history. The Elders of Israel approached the prophet Samuel with a demand that sounds suspiciously modern: "Appoint for us a king to judge us *like all the nations*."

The reaction from Heaven was devastating. Samuel was insulted, but God told him to take it personally: "They have not rejected you," God says, "they have rejected *Me* from being king over them."

The divine blueprint for Israel was never a centralized monarchy. God didn't want a "State" in the conventional sense; He wanted a Federation. He designed a system of twelve distinct tribes, each with its own territory, culture, and economy, bound together not by a strongman executive, but by a shared spiritual covenant. In God's vision, there was no seat for a human King because that seat was already taken.

But the people insisted. They didn't want to be special; they wanted to be "normal." They wanted the security and efficiency of a monarch. This ancient demand to be like all the other nations"—is the exact same impulse driving modern Zionism. Ben-Gurion wanted Israel to be a "normal" socialist state with its own criminals and policemen. Bibi wants Israel to be a "normal" economic superpower like Singapore. Both men fell into the trap of believing that the only way to survive is to copy the political architecture of the Gentiles. They viewed the decentralized, tribal chaos of Jewish life as a bug to be patched, rather than a feature designed by God Himself.

History shows us exactly where this desire leads. The "United Monarchy"—ancient Israel’s brief attempt at being a regional superpower under Solomon—ultimately backfired in the days of his son, Rehoboam. When Solomon died, the tribes came to the new King with a simple request: the central government had become too heavy, the taxes too high, the demands too great. They asked for the "yoke" to be lightened.

Rehoboam faced the classic dictator’s dilemma. His older, wiser advisors told him to serve the people and compromise. But his young, arrogant advisors told him to project strength. They told him that he "must have that iron in him". Rehoboam listened and delivered the most disastrous speech in Jewish history: "My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions."

The result was immediate and catastrophic. The people didn't bow down; they walked away. The cry went up: *"To your tents, O Israel!"*

This is the ancient version of the modern protest. When a leader tries to tighten the screws of the central authority—whether it’s Rehoboam with his taxes or Bibi with his judicial reforms—the "Jewish DNA" rejects the transplant. The tribes retreat to their tents. The Kingdom splits.

The tragedy is that we usually read "To your tents, O Israel!" as a cry of rebellion, a sign of failure. But perhaps it was actually a moment of clarity. Perhaps the people were instinctively running away from a foreign political model that was suffocating them and running back to the only structure that ever actually worked for the Jews.

They were running away from the Stone House and back to the Tent.

TODO: tie this back into my core argument of a five-state-solution. Do this by explaining how just like Ben-Gruion the House of David was a historical anamolly. Israel was surrounded by superpowers (Egypt, Philistines, Arameans) and so wanted to be like the nations. And this came with the costs we've discussed

## From Temple to Tabernacle
Some of you might reject this idea of a decentralized federation. TODO: talk about sinaat hinam After all, "division is what destroyed the Second Temple" you might say. But this completely misses the point. God never _wanted_ a temple. TODO: talk about the structure of the Tabernacle, how it was supposed to move between the tribes and be for everyone

TODO: explain that the sinaat hinam was only there _because_ of the zero sum competition for the vessel. It became a symbol of centralized authority. Why and how it lead to civil war and got destroyed

TODO: The 12 tribes were only supposed to agree on Spirituality, which was represented by a _moving_ Tabernacle and defense (the judges)

TODO: address Psalms 132 by explaining the difference between The Place and The Building. The tragedy of Jewish history is that we often mistake the Container for the Presence. When the First and Second Temples became tools of a corrupt monarchy or a priestly elite, God effectively "checked out" of the hotel. He returned to His "Tent" (the people) and left the "Building" (the stone house) to be burned.

TODO: talk about Amos, and how it says the third Temple will be a _sukka_ (a moving Tabernacle)

## A Light to the Nations
TODO: talk about how being a "light to the nations" has often been interpreted as being a powerhouse like Singapore. But we already have Singapore and many other successful countries. We have always had those. That is not what the world need. The world needs a country to set an example of harmony. To show the world that we can be different and still respect and protect each other. If Singapore is the example, it only says that the biggest country should bully everyone else into assimilating to a monolithic entity

By embracing the Zionist Dream, we are not merely applying a skeuomorphism from 1948. Rather, we are repeating the sins of our ancestors which date back to Biblical times. We are rejecting Yehovah and loosing the very thing that made Israel beautiful in the first place.

need to add amos and being a light to the nations
