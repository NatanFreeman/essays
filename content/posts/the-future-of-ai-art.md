## Art as a Casino
It is tempting to treat artists as R&D researchers. Most artists aren’t making products; they’re doing R&D. That’s why they make no money. Very few artists like Taylor Swift are even interested in the product side of things. By this view, Disney’s best bet is hiring hundreds of artists to just do whatever and greenlight the most commercially compelling work.

Nobody does this. Not because they're stupid, but because this strategy doesn't work for art. The closest equivalent is A24, the "cool" indie studio that has become a global tastemaker. Recently valued at $3.5 billion, they’ve built a lifestyle brand around "prestige" cinema, but they aren't like YC in the sense that they don't build from scratch. They go to film festivals and acquire finished R&D projects like *Everything Everywhere All At Once* or *The Brutalist*. In this sense, they're less of an incubator and more like a private equity firm. Moreover, it doesn't scale. This boutique model works for A24 because they can thrive on "small bites" of profit from $20 million movies. A studio like Disney, however, has such massive corporate overhead that it requires "Four-Quadrant" hits—billion-dollar behemoths that appeal to everyone simultaneously. You cannot reliably find a global, toy-selling franchise at a niche film festival. Disney needs hegemony, and hegemony doesn’t happen through auteur discovery; it happens through industrial engineering.

You can't treat the art industry like tech because unlike tech, the art industry is fundamentally broken. It relies on irrational actors and extreme outliers. The math is terrible no matter how you cut it. The cost of R&D is astronomically high, not just in money, but in the years of uncompensated time an artist spends mastering a craft that the market might never want. The vast majority of artists go broke, having spent their prime years chasing a statistical impossibility. However, the payoff of becoming an outlier like Lady Gaga is so massive—both financially and culturally—that this asymmetric upside keeps the engine running. It’s a lottery where the ticket costs ten years of your life, but the jackpot is immortality.

And who is paying this cost? If it was a rational market, you'd expect the VCs and companies to come in here. But in art, the Disneys of the world sleep. They let the _artists_ subsidize their own R&D. Artists are expected to work forty hours a week at a "day job" to pay for the privilege of doing their R&D at night. They buy their own equipment and fund their own marketing. As a result, corporations get a massive pool of "pre-vetted" talent and ideas for free. They don't have to bet on who *might* be talented; they just wait for someone to go viral on their own dime and then offer them a contract.

But why would artists do this to themselves? It is brutally inefficient and even cruel for an individual artist to work for years on a project that might never pay off. Economists and researchers have a name for this exploitation: the **"passion tax."** This is the systemic reality where the more an employee loves their work, the more the market feels entitled to underpay them. Because artists are intrinsically motivated to create, the industry can suppress wages to the point of subsistence, knowing the "enthusiastic" worker will keep producing even without a fair financial return.

The only reason this isn't considered _pure exploitation_ is Psychic Income. Artists receive a "wage" in the form of identity, status, and emotional fulfillment. To the artist, the work is the reward; the money is just a bonus. To the corporation, the artist's fulfillment is a subsidy that lowers their production costs.

This phenomenon creates a "Barbell Economy" where art becomes both cheaper and more expensive simultaneously, while the quality splits into two extremes. On one end of the barbell, you have $300 million blockbusters that are too big to fail. On the other end, you have a sea of "content"—ultra-cheap media produced for pennies. The "middle class" of art—the $20 million mid-budget movie or the professional musician who makes a comfortable living without being a superstar—is being squeezed out of existence because it carries the risk of R&D without the safety of a massive franchise.

The system is highly efficient for consumers (who get infinite art for cheap) but brutal for artists (who carry 100% of the risk). Art is "better" if you like variety, but "worse" if you want bold, high-budget risks from major studios.

## Enter AI

So how does AI art fit into this "business model"? One might assume this shifts things by making the R&D free. I suspect a lot of people in Silicon Valley have this sentiment. But what they miss is that the R&D was _already_ free. As in, the artists were already eating the costs themselves. The problem for Disney, HBO and Apple TV+ is not creating R&D but rather filtering out the garbage.

The vast majority of new art is terrible. This is not a fault - R&D is allowed to be terrible, that's the whole point. But it creates a problem when trying to commercialize. Because there is no objective metric for what makes art "good", we have to wait for the market to decide what sticks.

This isn't my fringe out-of-touch high-tech take. TODO: introduce Anthony Fantano Just listen to what Anthony Fantano has to say about 80s music being "better" than the music today:
> TODO: quote Anthony Fantano

An AI model which can predict what art will be good ahead of time will make billions. Except, such a model is impossible. In music, there is a very low signal to noise ratio. TODO: explain how studios are already doing this, the safe-hot trap, how this has lead to nothing but sequels. Conclude that finding outliers is just random noise and the market is the best engine for doing it reliably

A model which would have an accurate enough understanding of the world to predict success accurately, wouldn't be predicting art. It would be predicting stocks and wars. It's the closest thing to an AI god.

So what does the future of AI look like in this space? I argue its purpose will not be to make R&D cheaper, nor will it predict success. AI will be used to throw everything on the wall and see what sticks. This is how I predict the _pipeline_ will go. A "director" will create 100 movie trailers, upload them to TikTok and see what the **market** decides it most compelling. They will then rework and flesh out the concept into a finished product and release it in theaters. This will happen to everything from music to books and perhaps even video games. Game jams already fulfill a similar purpose there.

There is an elephant in the room I have not addressed. Artists hate AI. They usually give a host of reasons for this, but the most common rhetoric is that AI steals art. This doesn't make any sense because it implies the artists were getting paid in the first place. But if you recall our economic model you'd know that money was never part of the contract. The cold-hard truth is that you didn't become an artist to make money, you did it because it's what you loved. The real reason artists don't use AI is because they don't find it enjoyable. The aspect of creation they hold most dear is going to be completely automated in my proposed pipeline.

This is fantastic news! It means my pipeline kills the passion tax. Since "art" will be about optimizing and touching up someone else's idea, today's artists will hate it. This new industry will attract an audience who want to optimize a product and get paid farely reliably. The art industry stops being a casino and starts being an investment bank.

TODO: it would be nice to have some existing examples of people doing this

I'm sure artists are going to mourn and dub this "the death of art". In many ways they'll be correct. The wild west of art wonderland they hold dear _will_ be gone. Personally, I won't be too bothered. People who love creating for the sake of creating can still do so. The difference is that their passion will no longer be exploited by the fantasy of commercial success.
